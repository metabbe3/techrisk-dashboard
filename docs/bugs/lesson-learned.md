### [BUG-001] - Issues Export Tabs Showing Wrong Data (Severity instead of Incident Type)

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Discovered By:** User Report
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Resolved

### Description
The "Issues - MTTR" and "Issues - MTBF" export tabs were showing severity values (P1, P2, P3, etc.) in the "Type" column instead of the actual Incident Type name (e.g., "Bug", "Feature Request", etc.).

### Affected Component
- [x] Filament Resource (Export functionality)
- [ ] Model
- [ ] Controller
- [ ] API Endpoint
- [ ] Database/Migration
- [ ] Frontend/CSS
- [ ] Queue/Job
- [ ] Other: _____

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. Why did the bug occur?
   - The `IssuesMetricSheetExport` class was displaying `$incident->severity` in the "Type" column.

2. Why did that happen?
   - In commit `429726d` (2026-01-20), the `incident_type_id` foreign key relationship was added to the Incident model, and the UI was updated to show `incidentType.name` as a separate column.

3. Why was the export class not updated?
   - The `IssuesMetricSheetExport` class was not included in the commit that modified the `IssueResource` to use the new relationship.

4. Why wasn't it caught during review?
   - No code review process was followed for the commit, and the export functionality was not tested after the schema change.

5. Root cause identified:
   - **Incomplete migration impact analysis** - When adding the `incident_type_id` relationship, all code that displayed or exported incident type data should have been identified and updated together.

### Impact
- [x] User facing?
- [ ] Data loss/corruption?
- [x] Broken workflow?
- [ ] Performance degradation?
- [ ] Security vulnerability?
- [ ] Other: _____

**Impact Assessment:**
- Users exporting Issues data received incorrect information in the "Type" column
- Data was misleading - showed severity instead of incident type
- Affected decision-making based on exported reports
- Severity: High - Data integrity issue in reporting feature

### Prevention Strategy

#### 1. Process Changes
- [x] Update SOP - Added PM-centralized workflow with approval gates

### [BUG-002] - Issues Export Tabs Empty (Using Wrong Query Source)

**Date:** 2026-02-02
**Discovered By:** User Report
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Resolved

### Description
The "Issues - MTTR", "Issues - MTBF", and "All Issues" export tabs were returning empty or incorrect results because they were using the filtered query from IncidentResource instead of a fresh query for Issues only.

### Affected Component
- [x] Filament Resource (Export functionality)
- [ ] Model
- [ ] Controller
- [ ] API Endpoint
- [ ] Database/Migration
- [ ] Frontend/CSS
- [ ] Queue/Job
- [ ] Other: _____

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. Why did the bug occur?
   - The Issues sheets in `MultiSheetIncidentsExport` were cloning `$this->query` which comes from IncidentResource.

2. Why was this a problem?
   - IncidentResource's query includes all filters/tabs the user has selected (e.g., "Completed Cases", date ranges, severity filters).

3. Why did this cause empty Issues sheets?
   - When users filtered IncidentResource (e.g., by severity or status), those filters were applied to Issues sheets too.
   - For example: If user filtered to show "Completed Cases", the Issues sheets would try to find Issues within already-filtered Completed records, resulting in empty data.

4. Why was the export designed this way?
   - The export was added to IncidentResource, not IssueResource. The Issues sheets were an afterthought, added as filtered subsets of the main query.

5. Root cause identified:
   - **Incorrect query source for separate data domain** - Issues and Incidents are separate domains (classification = 'Issue' vs 'Incident'). Issues sheets should use a fresh query `Incident::where('classification', 'Issue')` instead of cloning the filtered IncidentResource query.

### Impact
- [x] User facing?
- [ ] Data loss/corruption?
- [x] Broken workflow?
- [ ] Performance degradation?
- [ ] Security vulnerability?
- [ ] Other: _____

**Impact Assessment:**
- Issues export tabs (All Issues, Issues - MTTR, Issues - MTBF) returned empty or incomplete data
- Users could not reliably export Issues data from IncidentResource
- Workaround: Users had to go to IssueResource to export Issues separately
- Severity: High - Core export functionality not working for Issues

### Prevention Strategy

#### 1. Process Changes
- [x] Document this pattern in SOP - When exporting separate domains, use fresh queries
- [ ] Add code review item: "Check if export filters affect different data domains"
- [ ] Require testing multi-sheet exports with various filter combinations

#### 2. Code Changes
- [x] Fixed Issues sheets to use `Incident::where('classification', 'Issue')` instead of `$this->query->clone()`
- [ ] Add test for export with active filters
- [ ] Add test for export with different selected tabs

#### 3. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with query pattern for multi-domain exports
- [x] Document this bug in lesson-learned.md

### Action Items
- [x] Fix Issues sheets to use fresh query - Done
- [x] Run Laravel Pint - Done
- [ ] Add integration test for multi-sheet export with filters - QA Team
- [ ] Test export with various filter combinations - User

### Verification
- [x] Code fixed: `app/Exports/MultiSheetIncidentsExport.php:56-69`
- [x] Laravel Pint applied
- [ ] Test case added: `tests/Feature/MultiSheetExportTest.php` - Pending
- [x] Code reviewed: Self-review completed
- [ ] Deployment verified on: YYYY-MM-DD - Pending
- [ ] No regression in existing tests - To be verified

### [BUG-003] - Excel Export Crash: Severity Enum Not Convertible to String

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Discovered By:** User Report (500 error)
**Severity:** High
**Status:** Resolved

### Description
Exporting incidents to Excel (single-sheet CSV/XLSX and the "export all tabs" multi-sheet XLSX) crashed with HTTP 500: "Object of class App\Enums\Severity could not be converted to string". The crash originated in PhpSpreadsheet's `DefaultValueBinder` when binding the severity cell.

### Affected Component
- [x] Filament Resource (Export functionality)
- [ ] Model
- [ ] Controller
- [ ] API Endpoint
- [ ] Database/Migration
- [ ] Frontend/CSS
- [ ] Queue/Job
- [ ] Other: _____

### Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys)
1. Why did the bug occur?
   - The export `map()` pushed `$incident->severity` (a `Severity` enum instance) directly into a spreadsheet cell; PhpSpreadsheet cannot stringify enum objects.

2. Why is `$incident->severity` an enum instance now?
   - Commit `c43fc3c` introduced `App\Casts\EnumCast` and cast `severity`, `incident_status`, `fund_status`, and `classification` on the Incident model to backed enums.

3. Why wasn't the export updated when the cast changed?
   - The commit's message stated it fixed "all enum-string consumers", but missed the Maatwebsite/Excel export `map()` methods (`IncidentTableExport`, `SingleIncidentSheetExport`).

4. Why wasn't it caught?
   - No test exercised the export `map()` with an enum-cast column, so the regression shipped unverified.

5. Root cause identified:
   - **Cast change with an incomplete consumer sweep + no export test coverage.** When a model attribute's type changes (string → enum), every downstream consumer — including export serializers — must be enumerated and tested, not only the ones that fail loudly.

### Impact
- [x] User facing?
- [ ] Data loss/corruption?
- [x] Broken workflow?
- [ ] Performance degradation?
- [ ] Security vulnerability?
- [ ] Other: _____

**Impact Assessment:**
- Users could not export incidents to Excel/CSV at all (hard 500 on both export paths).
- Severity: High — core reporting/export feature fully blocked.

### Prevention Strategy

#### 1. Process Changes
- [x] When changing a model cast, sweep all consumers (Filament, Blade, API, observers, exports/serializers) — not just the ones that break loudly.
- [x] Add export `map()` coverage to the regression-test set.

#### 2. Code Changes
- [x] Coerce `BackedEnum` → scalar value in `IncidentTableExport::map()` and `SingleIncidentSheetExport::map()`.
- [x] Added `tests/Feature/Exports/IncidentTableExportEnumTest.php` (asserts the severity cell is a string, not the enum instance).

#### 3. Documentation Updates
- [x] Document this bug in lesson-learned.md.

### Action Items
- [x] Fix export map() enum coercion - Done
- [x] Add regression test - Done
- [x] Run Laravel Pint - Done
- [ ] Test export end-to-end on the running app (both paths) - User

### Verification
- [x] Code fixed: `app/Exports/Sheets/SingleIncidentSheetExport.php`, `app/Exports/IncidentTableExport.php`
- [x] Test case added: `tests/Feature/Exports/IncidentTableExportEnumTest.php` (2 passing)
- [x] Laravel Pint applied
- [x] Code reviewed: Self-review completed
- [ ] Deployment verified on: YYYY-MM-DD - Pending
